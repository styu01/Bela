// 2026-08-01, measured on a wedged MAIN pane that had accumulated 489 characters
// of scheduled-task text over 7 visible rows.
//
// The old sequence was `C-u` x3, then `C-a` + `C-k`, then `C-u` x3 again, and it
// removed NOTHING across repeated runs. The reason is the cursor position: a
// literal string sent with tmux send-keys lands in FRONT of the parked text
//
//     before:  len=489  "the user if it looks wrong. The wrapper marks prov"
//     +MARKER: len=498  "MARKER123the user if it looks wrong. The wrapper m"
//     after C-u: len=489 "the user if it looks wrong. The wrapper marks prov"
//
// so the cursor sits at OFFSET 0. `C-u` kills BACKWARDS to the start of the
// line, finds nothing before the cursor, and is a no-op on every round -- it
// only ever removed the marker that had just been typed in front of it. The
// single `C-a` + `C-k` escalation then clears exactly ONE line, so a multi-line
// box could never be emptied: with PARKED_CLEAR_MAX = 3 the whole cascade could
// remove at most one line and then failed its own verification.
//
// Forward deletion drains it: `C-k` kills to end of line, `Delete` eats the
// newline joining the next one. The live box took 20 such rounds to reach zero.
